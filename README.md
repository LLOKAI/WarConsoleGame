This is one of my first projects.
It is a simple console game that simulates the entirety of a game of 'WAR' which is a popular card game.

RULES
Two players split a deck of cards in half after shuffling.
They then turn their half of the deck over, and both reveal their top card at the same time.
Whoever has the higher value card, wins both cards and the round. They take their new cards and add it to the bottom of the deck.
In the event that both players pull the same value card, a 'war' scenario is enacted.
The war scenario lets both players pull another card to compare, and the winner of that round wins all the cards in play.
If the war scenario is not handled in one additional round, the players keep pulling cards until one player wins the cards in play.
The game continues until one player has no cards left.
